⭐ Project Description: 
This is a simple and interactive To-Do List application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project allows users to create, organize, and manage daily tasks in a clean and user-friendly interface. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks they no longer need.
The main purpose of this project is to practice working with the DOM, event listeners, JSON formatting, and browser localStorage. All tasks are saved locally in the browser, so the user’s list stays available even after refreshing the page.
This project also helped me understand how to structure code using small reusable functions, follow good naming conventions, and separate logic from UI updates.

⭐ What I Learned: 
How to manipulate the DOM to create and update elements
How to store and read data from localStorage
How to work with JSON (JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse())
How to structure functions to keep the code readable
Basic separation of logic (e.g., handling UI vs handling data)
Importance of naming, small functions, and clean code practices
